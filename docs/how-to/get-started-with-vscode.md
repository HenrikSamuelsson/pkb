# Getting started with VS Code

VS Code is a powerful text editor, hidden behind a simple interface.

VS Code supports various **keyboard shortcuts**, some examples:

| Shortcut           | Action                       |
| ---                | ---                          |
| `ctrl + n`         | create new file              |
| `ctrl + s`         | save the current file        |
| `ctrl + o`         | launch file open dialogue    |
| `ctrl + p`         | list of recent files         |
| `ctrl + shift + p` | launch command palette       |

For more information, see the [VS Code keyboard cheat sheets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference), where you can also see how to customize your keybindings.

## Commands

Commands make VS Code extremely powerful.

To invoke a command, press `ctrl + shift + p` and select the command you want to execute.
For example, to see the Foam graph:

- Press `ctrl + shift + p`
- Start typing `show graph`
- Select the `Foam: Show Graph` command

And watch the magic unfold.

For more information on commands, see [commands on the VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

## Panels

You can see a few panels on the left, including:

- `Outline`: this panel shows you the structure of the file based on the headings
- `Tag Explorer`: This shows you the tags in your workspace, see [[tags-and-tag-explorer]] for more information on tags

## Settings

To view or change the settings in VS Code, press `ctrl + ,` or navigate to setting via the cog wheel in the lower left corner.
