# Book Notes - CMake Best Practices

## Chapter 1 - Kickstarting CMake

CMake is cross-platform free and open-source tool set for build automation, testing, packaging and installation of software. It is also compiler-independent which is a benefit to build and distribute cross-platform software.

CMake includes the following three command-line tools:

- `cmake`: CMake itself, used to generate build instructions
- `ctest`: CMake's test utility, used to detect an run tests
- `cpack`: CMake's packaging tool, used to pack software into install files
