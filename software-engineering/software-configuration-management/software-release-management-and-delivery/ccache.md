# Ccache

[Ccache](https://ccache.dev/) is a compiler cache that can speed up recompilation. Previous compilations are cached enabling reuse of already compiled artifacts.

Supports GCC, Clang and MSVC.

Could be useful to give a try if involved in a project where long compilation times is an issue that slows down development.
