# Struct Pattern

Struct Pattern is name after the struct keyword in C, and the struct pattern is typically used in C and C++, even though the general idea behind the pattern is not specific to these languages.

The key idea in  the struct pattern is that all data that a function operates on be passed to the function as an struct argument.
