# SOLID

In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin.

The acronym SOLID stands for:

- Single-responsibility
- Open-closed
- Liskov substitution
- Interface segregation
- Dependency inversion
