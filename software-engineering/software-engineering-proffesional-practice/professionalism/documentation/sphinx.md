Sphinx is a tool for generating software documentation. The source code is documented by the developer is a format called reStructuredText and is then converted into a HTML website or some of the other supported formats including PDF, EPub, Texinfo and man. Various HTML Themes are supported such as Read the Docs.

Sphinx is popular in the Python community and it is also written in Python, but it is not limited to use for documenting Python source code. For example so have Sphinx been used to document the Linux Kernel.
