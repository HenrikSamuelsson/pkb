# Breathe

[Breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a bridge between the Sphinx and Doxygen documentation systems.

It enables include of Doxygen information in a set of documentation generated by Sphinx. The aim is to produce an autodoc like support for people who enjoy using Sphinx but work with languages other than Python. The system relies on the Doxygenâ€™s xml output.
