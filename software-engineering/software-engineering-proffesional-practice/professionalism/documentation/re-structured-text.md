# reStructuredText

reStructuredText (RST, ReST, or reST) is a file format for textual data used primarily in the Python programming language community for technical documentation.

RST is a markup language with readable syntax. It is often used in combination with Sphinx.

RST is for example used to document CMake and the Linux Kernel.
