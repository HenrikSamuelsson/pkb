# Project Uncertainty Space

A project will in the beginning have many uncertainties, these are sometimes categorized into two types called ends-uncertainty and means-uncertainty.

End-uncertainty refers to what the will need to be done. It can in the beginning of a project be low knowledge about what needs to be done. As the project goes along and requirements have been collected and feedback have been received on prototypes so will the ends uncertainty become lower.

Means-uncertainty refers to how the project will be done. If the goal of the project is to develop a product so will this involve uncertainties about design and development. As with end-uncertainties start-out high and go towards low as the project is completed.
