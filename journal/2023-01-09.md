## Setting up CMake on Dell Computer

Reading the book Fluent C and wanted to test some of the code in the book. Decided to build with CMake to practice my skills with this build system. Turned out that I did not have CMake properly installed on my Dell computer. Installed CMake with Chocolatey. Then the CMake configuration step failed due to not having a generator tool. Installed Ninja, again using Chocolatey. Could after that build a dummy C++ example using CMake. Remains to build a C example from the book.
