## Get Started With CMake Tools

Completed the tutorial [Get started with CMake Tools on Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/CMake-linux).

One mistake that I made at first was that I had spaces in my initially chosen project name called `CMake Quick Start Test`. This turned out to cause issues. Changed name to a camel case variant `cmakeQuickStartTest`. After this fix everything worked fine.

## Code Coverage Tools

Learned about code coverage tools when reading in the book CMake Best Practices. These are tools that measure how much of the code that is covered by unit test. The following tools where discussed in the book [GCOV](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/), [LCOV](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov), and [OpenCppCoverage](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage). Need to learn more about these types of tools and integrate them in my development projects.
