## Get started with CMake Tools

Completed the tutorial [Get started with CMake Tools on Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/CMake-linux).

One mistake that I made at first was that I had spaces in my initially chosen project name called `CMake Quick Start Test`. This turned out to cause issues. Changed name to a camel case variant `cmakeQuickStartTest`. After this fix everything worked fine.
