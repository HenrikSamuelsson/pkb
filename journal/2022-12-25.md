## CMake Best Practices

Have bought the book CMake Best Practices and read in this book today.

## Foam Graph

Had a problem that I could not see my changes in the Foam Graph view. Took a while to figure out that the problem wast that the new note that I had created did not end with .md. After renaming the file it showed up in the Foam Graph as it should.

## OpenSSL

CMake complained about not being able to find OpenSSL on my computer, this happened when building the entire project from the book CMake Best Practices. Found out via [StackOverflow - How to install OpenSSL in Windows 10](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62586085/686720) that Chocolatey can install OpenSSL.

Opened a Powershell terminal in administrator mode and ran the command:

```txt
choco install openssl
```

This installed OpenSSL and also updated my PATH to be able to use OpenSSL. Could after running this installation run CMake without errors about OpenSSL.
