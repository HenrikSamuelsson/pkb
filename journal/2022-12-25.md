## CMake Best Practices

Have bought the book CMake Best Practices and read in this book today.

## Foam Graph

Had a problem that I could not see my changes in the Foam Graph view. Took a while to figure out that the problem wast that the new note that I had created did not end with .md. After renaming the file it showed up in the Foam Graph as it should.
